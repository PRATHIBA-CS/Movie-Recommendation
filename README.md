Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system that leverages data science and machine learning to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system utilizes a combination of movie metadata from TMDB, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering to suggest movies similar to a user's selection. The user interacts with the system through a web application built using Streamlit.
